The paper is accepted in LREC-COLING 2024.

Following is contained in the Repository:
- Code and parameters for our benchmark model
- model weights for our benchmark model
-  The implementation is an extension of the following [work](https://github.com/ninatu/everything_at_once). This repository provides the pretrained backbone models and features used for fine-tuning and evaluations.

##Environment setup:
